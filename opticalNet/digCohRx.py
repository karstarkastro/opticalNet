#   @brief Polarization Demultiplexing by CMA algorithm
#   
#   Polarization Demux is accomplished by implementing the Constant Modulus
#   Algorithm [1]. This algorithm is used to demultiplex M-PSK modulations, where
#   the radius of the circle formed in the constellation diagram has unit value
#   in all cases. This algorithm is not valid for M-QAM modulations with the 
#   exception of 4-QAM which is basically QPSK.

#   @param signal   2-by-n matrix where the rows are the X and Y polarizations
#	@param filter 	Boolean that determines the type of data that will be returned 
#					by the function. If False it returns the demultiplexed signal 
#					(which is the case for mPSK or 4-QAM signals) while if True it 
#					returns the 4 filter taps and the number of taps for each filter
#					(which is the case for pilot-based mQAM signals)
